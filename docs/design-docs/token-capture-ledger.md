# Token Capture Lineage Ledger

Exact-token capture for blackbox agentic rollouts is coordinated by a single
per-rollout **capture ledger**: NeMo Gym's `LineageStore`, extended so that its
append-only JSONL rows are simultaneously the request-time lineage index and
the token-free record of rollout capture state. There is no separate gate
state machine; serving workers coordinate only through the ledger, and NeMo RL
(the rollout owner) assembles the `RolloutReceipt` itself at rollout end.

The external staging contract (`StagingSink` / `StagingSource`), the vLLM
worker capture path, and the `verify_and_linearize()` trust boundary are
unchanged from the worker-custody design. The recipe exercising this path end
to end is [Nano SWE with Token Capture](../guides/nano-swe-token-capture.md);
the verification trust boundary is described in
[Rollout Verification Boundary](rollout-verification-boundary.md).

## Why a ledger and not a gate

An earlier iteration paired the lineage store with a `RolloutCaptureGate` and
a cross-process `GateStateStore`. The gate did not provide a second lineage
algorithm — parent resolution ran upstream through `LineageStore.resolve()`,
and the gate cross-checked that result against its own copy of the call state,
storing each call's cumulative token IDs **twice** (gate state + lineage
JSONL). Its file-backed state store also serialized the entire global gate
state — every live rollout's cumulative token arrays — under one exclusive
lock, three transactions per model call.

Everything the gate legitimately provided — admission, rollout completeness,
terminal selection, cleanup — is either a pure function of the lineage result
or belongs to the framework that already owns the rollout. So each
responsibility moved to its natural owner and the redundant state machine was
deleted.

## The ledger

`FileLineageStore` writes one locked, fsynced JSONL row per committed call.
In external-staging mode (`token_id_capture.external_staging: true`) each row
additionally carries the token-free `CallRecord` custody columns —
`parent_call_id`, `staging_key`, `weight_version`, `prev_len` / `delta_len` /
`cum_len`, the staged record's `digest` and `extras_digest`, `mode`, and
`logical_request_id` (the client header when present, else the vLLM response
id). Three surfaces make it the single record of capture state (the
`CaptureLedger` protocol):

- `record(...)` — the extended commit row, written by the model server's
  commit hook after the worker's `CommitCoords` arrive.
- `record_failure(rollout_id, model_call_id, reason)` — a poison row for a
  call whose capture did not commit. Failure rows carry no fingerprint, so
  `resolve()` can never return them as parents.
- `manifest(rollout_id)` — the token-free read-back (committed rows +
  failures), exposed over one bearer-protected control route:
  `GET /training-token-capture/rollouts/{rollout_id}/manifest`.

`InMemoryLineageStore` cannot serve the ledger role: its resolution index
evicts rollouts under memory bounds, which is fine for a cache but not for a
completeness record. External staging requires a non-evicting store and
rejects the in-memory store at startup.

## Admission is a pure function

When external staging is enabled, `resolve_parent()` builds the
`CaptureAdmission` directly from the lineage result — a strict tri-state:

| Lineage outcome | Admission |
| --- | --- |
| `ROOT` — empty assistant fingerprint, or unmatched fingerprint on a rollout with no ledger rows (seeded assistant history) | `text` mode, no parent |
| `MATCH` — unique fingerprint match with verified context digest | `token_in` mode, `required_prefix_token_ids` = parent's cumulative tokens |
| `UNRESOLVED` — non-empty fingerprint with no match, ambiguity, or digest mismatch | no admission; `record_failure()` poisons the call |

`UNRESOLVED` is never silently converted into a new root: doing so would turn
earlier policy-generated tokens into mask-zero prompt tokens and corrupt the
training row. The completion still serves the agent; only training capture is
poisoned.

## Commit ordering

The invariant the external sink requires — *a call must not become a lineage
parent until its staged record is durable* — holds structurally: the worker
stages through `StagingSink.stage()` before acknowledging, coordinates exist
only after the bytes are durable, and the ledger row (which is what makes a
call resolvable as a parent) is written only after the coordinates arrive.
On `disposition == "staged"` the commit hook reconstructs
`cumulative = parent_tokens + token_ids_delta` and appends the extended row;
on `capture_failed`, missing coordinates, or any acknowledgement error it
appends a failure row instead. A request that dies after admission is poisoned
from the capture middleware's `finally` hook.

### Megatron Inference payload staging

MInf uses the same durability boundary through its `RequestPayloadStager`
protocol. Each model-parallel coordinator installs NeMo RL's
`TQRequestPayloadStager`; when a request completes, MInf synchronously writes
the full `OffloadedRequestPayload` to the staging partition under the response
UID before returning the token-light HTTP response. The stager and the vLLM
Gym sink share `TQStagingStore`, so partition addressing, local-versus-Ray
client dispatch, reads, and cleanup have one implementation.

`OffloadedRequestPayload` does not carry the request's policy epoch. MInf's
small local metadata ledger remains enabled for that field only: the stager
consumes the just-completed UID's epoch record in-process and stamps it on the
same TQ row. This preserves a request that overlaps an epoch change and does
not reintroduce engine-side token custody or a driver-side flush.

Gym records a `PendingCallRecord` containing that response UID and the HTTP
lineage witnesses. It does not copy the offloaded payload back through the RL
driver. At finalization, the CPU actor fetches the UID-keyed rows, validates
their token lengths and hashes against the pending records, and uses Gym's
capture builder to construct canonical records in memory for the existing
`verify_and_linearize()` boundary. The physical UID keys remain the cleanup
and recovery keys; there is no second heavy-token write.

## Framework-owned receipt and cleanup

NeMo RL fetches the manifest at rollout end and assembles the receipt locally.
For vLLM:

- `manifest` = the fetched `CallRecord` list, deduped by `model_call_id`;
- `terminal_model_call_id` = the row whose `logical_request_id` matches the
  rollout's reported terminal logical request (a response id);
- `capture_poisoned` = any failure row present, or no row for the terminal
  request.

For MInf, `manifest` is empty and `pending_manifest` contains the token-light
`PendingCallRecord` rows. Those rows are already durable references because
MInf staged each payload before exposing its response. The recovery ledger
therefore seals the receipt immediately and owns the referenced response UIDs
until finalization publishes or rejects the rollout.

Terminal selection has a strict precedence: **declared > heuristic > mask**. A
harness-declared terminal is authoritative — a declared id that matches no
committed row masks the rollout and never falls back. When the harness reports
no terminal at all, Gym's `select_terminal_call` infers one from the
manifest's explicit parent links (earliest-admitted root by `admitted_at`, an
extended sibling beating an abandoned childless retry); any ambiguous shape —
a retry of the final call, divergent extended branches — masks with the
selection reason. The heuristic only chooses *among* digest-verified rows:
`verify_and_linearize` still verifies the chosen chain. The receipt records
the path in `terminal_selection` and the finalizer emits
`finalize/heuristic_terminal_fraction` per group.

`verify_and_linearize(receipt, snapshots)` runs unchanged. Retry duplicates
appear as dead-branch sibling rows in the manifest: their staged rows are
fetched, verified, and cleaned like any other, but they never join the
terminal chain (`_validate_manifest_graph` tolerates rows unreferenced by the
terminal chain). Cleanup is manifest-enumerated in the finalizer; an abandoned
dispatch's staged rows are swept with the staging partition at run end (there
is no prefix-clear primitive in the data plane yet).

## Failure semantics (all fail-closed)

- **Capture fails mid-rollout:** the model call still succeeds for the agent;
  a failure row is written. Later calls miss resolution → `UNRESOLVED` →
  more failure rows. Finalization sees failure rows → poisoned → masked
  placeholder row (the group still publishes exactly N rows).
- **Terminal response lost, harness retries:** the retry is a sibling row
  (per-request `uuid4` identity). The harness reports the retry's response id,
  so receipt assembly selects the retry's row; the lost attempt is a dead
  branch. An ambiguous mid-rollout sibling (identical regenerated text)
  poisons via `UNRESOLVED` instead of silently becoming a root.
- **Crash after staging, before the ledger append:** descendants resolve
  `UNRESOLVED` and poison; a terminal orphan poisons via the missing terminal
  row.

Retry *idempotency* (harness-minted logical request ids + deterministic
`model_call_id`, collapsing identical retries into the same row instead of
poisoning) is an explicit follow-up; no retry outcome is silently wrong today.
